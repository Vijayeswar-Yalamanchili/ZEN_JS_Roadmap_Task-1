Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

A : 
    HTTP 1.1    : It works on the textual format.
                  There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
                  It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
                  It compresses data by itself.
                  loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it

    HTTP 2      : It works on the binary protocol.
                  It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
                  It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
                  It uses HPACK for data compression.
                  is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
