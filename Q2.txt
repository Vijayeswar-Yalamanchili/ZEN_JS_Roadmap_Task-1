Q : Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

A : Objects are Non-primitive or Reference datatype & case sensitive, allows to store and organize data.
    Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
    Objects are instances of a class,consists of key value pair. where keys are strings and values can be any datatype
    These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
    Properties are essentially key-value pairs, and methods are functions associated with the object. When a property is accessed or modified, the JavaScript engine looks up the property name in the object's internal structure to retrieve or update the corresponding value.
